Hello OMSCS Students,<br />

<p>Please read the information below regarding Fall 2019 Phase II registration.  There is an FAQ section at the bottom which should be helpful and answer many of your questions.</p>


<strong>1.  Time Tickets</strong><br />

<p>Time tickets tell you the exact day and time you will be able to start registering for your classes.  Here is the link on how to view your time ticket:  https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/time-tickets.</p>


<p>Time tickets will be available to view for Fall 2019 Phase II registration after 6:00pm ET on Friday, August 9.  <strong>Please note that registration does NOT begin at this time.</strong>  Your time ticket will tell you the exact day and time that you can begin registering during the Phase II registration window.</p>


<p>Time tickets are issued based on the number of earned hours you have completed to date.  Time tickets are issued by the Registrar’s Office, and the OMSCS advising team unfortunately has no control over the process.  We do not know the allocation of time tickets until they are released to students.</p>


<strong>2.  Registration Holds</strong><br />

<p>It is possible you may have a registration hold due to missing documents or due to not completing the Foundational Requirement on schedule.  Here is the link to check your holds:  https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/holds.  The department who issued the hold must clear your hold.</p>


<p>If you have an “immunization" hold, please send an email to immunizations@health.gatech.edu to request a waiver so that you can get that hold removed.</p>


<p>If you were due to complete your Foundational Requirement, and you have not yet completed it, you will be restricted from registering for any course that is not a Foundational course.</p>


<p>**If you HAVE completed your Foundational Requirement, and you still have a foundational hold or cohort restriction on your account, please open a ticket with oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu, and we will remove it for you.  Please include your full name and nine-digit GT ID number (90X-XX-XXXX) in that ticket.**</p>


<strong>3.  How to Register for Classes</strong><br />

<p>Here is the link on how to register for classes:  https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/registration-information.  Please be sure to follow these step-by-step instructions carefully.</p>


<strong>4.  Fall 2019 Facts</strong><br />

<p>Phase II Registration begins on Saturday, August 10 and ends at exactly 4:00pm ET on Friday, August 23.</p>



<p>The Fall 2019 term is from August 19 to December 14.  You can check the Fall 2019 term's academic calendar on the Registrar’s website at https://registrar.gatech.edu/calendar.</p>


<p>There are now both “CSE” and “ISYE” classes offered in addition to “CS” classes; therefore, be sure to do a search on “CS”, “CSE”, and “ISYE" for a full listing of the online courses offered.  The search for CS is "Computer Science", the search for CSE is "Computational Science and Engineering”, and the search for ISYE is “Industrial and Systems Engineering”.</p>


<p><strong>As a reminder, some of these courses will be offered with the OMS Analytics or the OMS Cybersecurity programs, so please be mindful when selecting courses that you are choosing the appropriate section for OMSCS students.  Some sections are restricted to OMS Analytics students only and are designated with the “OAN" section.  Other sections are restricted to OMS Cybersecurity students only and are designated with the “OCY" section.</strong></p>


<strong>5.  Waitlisting</strong><br />

<p>We WILL be waitlisting during Phase II for Fall 2019.  Please remember that the wait lists do not "go live" until the final time ticket has opened for registration.</p>


<p>If you change your mind about a course you are waitlisted for, you have to remove yourself from the wait list.  We cannot remove you.</p>


<p>Additionally, we cannot add students to the wait list — you must add yourself.</p>

<p>For more information about waitlisting, please visit:  https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/waitlists.    </p>

<p>***You only have 12 hours to add the course after you receive the wait list notification.*** </p>

<p>Please note that there are two different reasons why you might be issued a wait list notification:  either we have added seats to a course, or someone else drops the class and releases the seat.  We can control when we add seats, but we cannot control when someone else drops.  If you receive a wait list notification at midnight, it is because someone else dropped the course at that time, and we cannot control that.</p>

<p>Once you receive the notification, you must add by CRN.  Add by look up does not work for waitlisted courses.</p>

<p>If you do not register within the 12-hour period, you will be dropped from the wait list, and the next person on the list will receive permission to enroll.  We have no control over this.  If this happens, your only option is to add yourself back to the wait list and hope for the best.</p>

<p>PLEASE do not add yourself to the wait list for every class.  Waitlisting for ONLY the courses you want helps us better determine demand.  At no time should your hours registered + hours waitlisted exceed 6 hours.</p>

<strong>6.  Maximum Hours</strong><br />

<p>This is a reminder that students are restricted to a maximum of SIX credit hours for Fall and Spring terms.</p>


<strong>7.  OMS Analytics Courses Available for OMSCS Students</strong><br />

<p>We have received confirmation that there are two OMS Analytics courses that will be offered to OMSCS students for the Fall 2019 semester:</p>


<p>— ISYE 6402 Time Series Analysis will be opened to a small number of OMSCS students.  This course does not fulfill any of the specializations offered through the OMSCS program and therefore will not count toward the foundational requirement.  It can be counted toward the “free” elective requirement of the MSCS degree.</p>

<p>— ISYE 6420 Bayesian Statistics also will be available for OMSCS students to take in Fall 2019.  Again, the enrollment in this course will be limited.  This course satisfies the specialization elective requirement for Machine Learning (http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/specialization-machine-learning) and will be considered as a foundational course.</p>

<p>***Please remember that per the program rules (https://www.cc.gatech.edu/future/masters/mscs):  "A maximum of 6 hours may be taken at the 4000-level and/or with a subject code other than CS or CSE.”***</p>

<strong>8.  OMS Cybersecurity Courses Available for OMSCS Students</strong><br />

<p>As a reminder, there are two OMS Cybersecurity courses that are being offered to OMSCS students for the Fall 2019 semester:</p>


<p>— CS 6265 Information Security Lab will be opened to a small number of OMSCS students.  The course description listed on the OMS Cybersecurity’s website (https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/cybersecurity?section=curriculum) states the following:  Computer systems and network vulnerabilities, information warfare, network and operating system security techniques, security analysis tools.  This course does not fulfill any of the specializations offered through the OMSCS program and therefore will not count toward the foundational requirement.  It can be counted toward the “free” elective requirement of the MSCS degree.</p>


<p>— CS 6238 Secure Computer Systems also will be available for OMSCS students to take in Fall 2019.  Again, the enrollment in this course will be limited.  This course satisfies the specialization elective requirement for Computing Systems (http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/specialization-computing-systems) and will be considered as a foundational course.</p>

<strong>9.  Declare Your Specialization Before Registration Starts</strong><br />

<p>This is a reminder that if you haven’t done so already, you should declare your specialization in OSCAR as soon as you know which one you will pursue.  This helps us determine course demand and also enables advisors to better assist you when you have questions about what courses you need to take.  This also allows you to be able to use DegreeWorks for "self service" by applying the correct curriculum to your degree program.</p>

<p>As a reminder, to declare your specialization, you should go to OSCAR to the Student Services and Financial Aid menu->Student Records->Change Program of Study, select “MSCS", and then choose your specialization from the list.  Please remember that OMSCS students can only select one of the four specializations offered through the OMSCS program:  Computational Perception and Robotics, Computing Systems, Interactive Intelligence, or Machine Learning.</p>

<strong>10.  Fee Payment Deadline</strong><br />

<p>The deadline to pay your tuition for Fall 2019 is Monday, August 26 at 4:00pm ET.</p>

<strong>11.  Fall 2019 Degree Candidates</strong><br />

<p>The Fall 2019 degree candidates who need to enroll in specific specialization courses and are already on the wait lists are being bumped up to the top.  This means that some of your wait list positions may have changed or will change since Phase I.  You can verify your wait list position by checking your "Student Detail Schedule" section in OSCAR.  As needed, we will be monitoring registration and bumping Fall 2019 degree candidates who have not yet added themselves to the wait list(s) for the specialization course(s) they need.  Please note that this only will be done for students who have turned in their Program of Study to their advisor, and we only assist with specialization courses (not “free" electives).</p>


<strong>12.  DegreeWorks</strong><br />

<p>This is a reminder that you can review your academic progress at any time by logging onto DegreeWorks at www.degreeworks.gatech.edu using your GT credentials.  Here you also can review your degree status (if you have petitioned to graduate) and any exceptions that we have applied to your program of study.  It is advisable for all students to look at DegreeWorks at least once per semester during a regular enrolled term and at least four times per semester during your graduating semester (before Phase II registration ends, after Phase II ends, after the withdrawal deadline, and after final grades are in).  If you find any discrepancies, please report those to your advisor.  Please note that we generally do not apply exceptions in DegreeWorks until AFTER you have petitioned to graduate.</p>

<p>We hope you have a great semester!<br />

Sincerely,<br />

<h2>FAQs</h2><br />


<p><strong>Q:  Can I take the Fall 2019 semester off without penalty?</strong><br />

A:  If you enrolled in Summer 2019, you can take Fall 2019 off without penalty.  If you did not enroll in Summer 2019, you must enroll in Fall 2019 or else you will have to apply for readmission.  As a reminder, a “W" counts as a record of enrollment.  Therefore, if you withdrew from your Summer 2019 course, this counts as a record of enrollment.  Please refer to the Orientation document for more information regarding readmission and skipping a semester.</p>

<p><strong>Q:  When can I declare my specialization?</strong><br />

A:  You can declare your specialization anytime EXCEPT during an active registration period.  If you plan to graduate at the end of Fall 2019, you will need to declare your specialization before registration begins.</p>

<p><strong>Q:  I have a missing documentation hold.  How do I get it removed?</strong><br />

A:  Please contact Graduate Studies at 404-894-1610 or by sending a message to gradinfo@mail.gatech.edu.  Please include your full name and your nine-digit GT ID number (90X-XX-XXXX).</p>

<p><strong>Q:  I did not receive the Fall 2019 Orientation document.  How can I obtain a copy?</strong><br />

A:  Please visit https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/online-ms-cs/omscsportal.</p>

<p><strong>Q:  I have a cohort restriction, but I completed my Foundational Requirement.  What should I do?</strong><br />

A:  Send an email to oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu and request to have that restriction removed.  Please include your full name and your nine-digit GT ID number (90X-XX-XXXX).</p>


<p><strong>Q:  Can I take CS 6515 if I have taken CS 6505 and/or CS 8803 GA/CSE 6140/CS 4540?</strong><br />
A:  No, you cannot take CS 6515 if you have taken CS 6505, CS 8803 GA, CSE 6140, and/or CS 4540, as these are considered to be equivalent courses.</p>


<p><strong>Q:  Why does my time ticket not become active as soon as the registration period opens?</strong><br />


A:  Graduate students are typically one of the last groups to become active as far as time tickets during registration.  Therefore, it is possible that your time ticket may not be active on the first day of registration.</p>



<p><strong>Q:  I am graduating at the end of the Fall 2019 semester, but I cannot register for and/or wait list for the course(s) I need to graduate.  What do I do?</strong><br />

A:  The academic advisors have completed the first audit for potential Fall 2019 degree candidates and made note of which courses students need in order to graduate.  Please be sure to enroll in the course(s) you need to graduate as soon as your time ticket opens.  If the courses are full, be sure to add yourself to the wait list and monitor your account frequently and carefully so that you do not miss a wait list notification, if you receive one.  As an official degree candidate (meaning that you submitted your OAG and completed Program of Study form by our departmental deadline), you will receive priority on the wait list for the specialization course(s) you need to graduate next semester.  Please note that priority will not be given for “free" electives.  Overall, please do not panic if you are not able to add the particular course(s) you need right away.</p>


<p><strong>Q:  I missed my wait list notification.  What do I do now?</strong><br />

A:  The only thing you can do is get back on the wait list and hope for the best, or select another course.</p>


<p><strong>Q:  How can I see my wait list position?</strong><br />

A:  The best way for a student to check his/her wait list number is from the "Student Detail Schedule" section of OSCAR.</p>


<p><strong>Q:  What if I am still on a wait list for a course at this point?</strong><br />

A:  It is highly likely that more seats will be added to most classes as more TAs are identified and hired.  As always, please continue monitoring the course/wait list, as advisors cannot predict if/when additional seats will be opening, and there is nothing that can be done if you miss your wait list notification.</p>


<p><strong>Q:  Will everyone on the wait list get in/will more seats become available?</strong><br />

A:  Please note that just because you on a wait list, that does not mean you will receive a notification to register for the course.  This only happens when a seat becomes available in the course, so we cannot guarantee that everyone on every wait list will get in.  Some classes are unable to scale above a certain max and still provide an effective learning experience for students.  Please note that the advisors are unable to determine/predict which courses will have more seats added.</p>


<p><strong>Q:  What are my chances of getting into a specific course and/or wait list?</strong><br />
A:  We strive to give all students an opportunity to register for a variety of courses.  However, advisors cannot predict if/when a course may have more seats added or if a wait list will be expanded, nor can we predict the chances a student has of enrolling in a specific course from the wait list.  Our best advice is to continue monitoring the course(s) you are interested in taking and/or the wait list(s) for those courses.</p>

<p><strong>Q:  What does X registration error mean?</strong><br />

A:  If you are trying to register for a course, and you receive an error message, please refer to the following link for an explanation of what the error message means:  https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/error-messages.</p>
